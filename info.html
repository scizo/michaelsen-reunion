  <p>
  It all began at Aunt LaRue’s in 1949 during a birthday party for Grandma Ella.
  Ella was concerned that her large family, then living in Utah, Wyoming and
  California, would not get together regularly. At that moment they agreed to
  come together each August to keep the family bonds strong and the love alive.
  And it worked!

  2012 marks the 63rd annual Michaelsen Family reunion in Mayfield, Utah -- known
  to many of us as simply “The Mayfield Reunion.” This year we will welcome over
  250 family members–four generations–from all over the nation. We’ll serve over
  1200 meals, eat more treats than we'll admit, tell stories, reconnect with
  family members and make new friends as we celebrate a remarkable and long legacy
  of what it means to be a family!
